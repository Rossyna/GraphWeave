mp4toavi.exe is an executable file associated with the Free MP4 to AVI Converter software developed by Jacek Pazera, specifically version 1.15.0.0, which is designed to convert MP4 video files into the AVI format. Generally, this software is considered safe to use, as it is a legitimate tool provided by a reputable publisher; however, users should always ensure they download it from official or trusted sources to avoid potential malware or unwanted programs.
